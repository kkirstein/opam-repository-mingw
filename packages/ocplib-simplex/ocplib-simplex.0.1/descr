A library implementing a simplex algorithm, in a functional style, for solving systems of linear inequalities

ocplib-simplex is a (fully) functional OCaml implementation of the
simplex algorithm for solving systems of linear inequalities. The
implementation is incremental and backtrackable. It is able to extract
unsat-cores for unsatisfiable problems. Linear optimization is
currently not supported.
